  <p>Welcome! I am a scholar of English literature, a teacher, and a librarian-in-training.<p>
  <p>Currently, I am a student at Simmons University in Boston, earning
    my MLIS degree with a concentration in Archives Management.
    To gain experience as a librarian, I also work several part-time jobs: I'm a Digitization Assistant
    in the Schlesinger Library at Harvard, a Manuscript Processing and Digitization Assistant in the Phillips
    Library at the Peabody Essex Museum, and a Reference Assistant at Boston College. After I complete my MLIS degree,
    I hope to pursue a career in special collections librarianship.</p>
  <p>Before moving into a career in library science, I worked for over a decade as a scholar and teacher of
    English literature. I got my B.A. at Walla Walla University with a triple major in English, religion,
    and biblical languages. I then earned my M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in English
    literature. I focused on medieval and Renaissance literature, and my dissertation was about the poet John
    Milton's responses to seventeenth-century English Sabbath debates. After graduate school, I returned to Walla
    Walla University to work as an English professor, earning tenure there. I taught courses for
    the English Department and Honors Program on academic writing and research, medieval and Renaissance
    literature, religion and literature, and literary theory. I also served for a year as
    Director of the Honors Program. I published articles in peer-reviewed journals including <i>The Seventeenth
    Century</i>, <i>Religion and Literature</i>, and <i>Milton Studies</i>. My article in <i>Milton Studies</i>
    won the 2018 James Holly Hanford Article Award, presented annually by the Milton Society of America
    for the best article on John Milton. I continue to be an active scholar, and my research interests include
    early modern English literature, religious history and biblical studies, gender studies, and book history.</p>
