<h2>Current Project</h2>
  <p>I am currently working on a book project tentatively titled <i>Remembering the Sabbath: Law, Labor, and Liberty in
    Seventeenth-Century English Literature</i>. It examines literary writings about the Sabbath in
    early modern England and demonstrates that arguments for Sabbath-keeping were not only arguments for a "Protestant work ethic"
    that contributed to the decline of “merry England,” as is often supposed. Rather, literary authors from a range of political and
    religious affiliations found in the Sabbath&#8212particularly in Jewish teachings about
    the Sabbath in the Hebrew Bible, the Kabbalah, and Jewish culture&#8212a radical symbol of rest, liberation, equality, and justice.
    In Jewish teaching, the Sabbath regulates rest and labor, celebrates liberation from Egyptian slavery, and functions as a time for
    weddings and sexual unions. The related sabbatical year and year of jubilee also provide times for
    the land to lie fallow, debts to be forgiven, and slaves to be released. Early modern
    Christian writers drew on these themes in the Sabbath’s heritage to protest exploitative labor practices, envision
    more equitable and inclusive romantic and sexual relationships, and critique the African slave trade. I begin
    the study with the lyrics of Herrick and Marvell; then turn to Milton’s divorce tracts, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and
    <i>Samson Agonistes</i>; and conclude with Behn’s <i>Oroonoko</i>.</p>

  <p>Abstract: The English Quaker Margaret Fell worked hard to have her conversionist pamphlets to
    Dutch Jews translated into Hebrew, and Richard Popkin has suggested that Spinoza was Fell’s
    translator. This article offers further evidence for Popkin’s claim by suggesting that Fell’s
    influence can be seen in chapters 4 and 5 of Spinoza’s <i>Theological-Political Treatise</i>. Fell’s
    and Spinoza’s remarks about Judaism and Jewish ceremonies bear significant similarities, as do the
    biblical passages they use to support their statements. Spinoza also challenges Fell’s arguments,
    though, by resisting her Pauline method of reading the Hebrew Bible and reading with a historicist
    method instead. Spinoza’s apparent use and revision of Fell’s arguments are significant because
    they speak to the role of the Quakers – and, notably, of a Quaker woman – in early modern
    intellectual history and because they sharpen our view of Spinoza’s opinions of Judaism.</p>

  <p>Abstract: This article reconsiders Samson's relationship to Hebrew law and Christian liberty in
    <i>Samson Agonistes</i> by reading the drama alongside the seventeenth-century Sabbath debates.
    Milton, like many participants in the debates, was especially intrigued by the Sabbath teachings in
    Isaiah's final chapters. Isaiah seemingly offered an opportunity to unite the Hebrew and
    Christian scriptures because the book both exhorted readers to observe Hebrew Sabbath law and could
    be read as prefiguring Christ's work to free the oppressed. Amidst these discussions, Milton's
    Samson emerges as an Isaian hero who anticipates Christ's liberating labors not by breaking Hebrew
    law but by obeying it.</p>
